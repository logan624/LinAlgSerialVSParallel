# MATH 374 -- Scientific Computation -- Final Project
## Serial and Parallel Methods for Solving Systems of Linear Equations
### Running the Project
This project should be run by, from the root directory of the project generating a sparse system of linear equations:
`python src/data/gen_data.py`
After this is completed, each of the methods can be run by running the command:
`python src/methods/<method_name>.py`
After each method is run, a CSV file will be generated for analysis if it is wanted.
